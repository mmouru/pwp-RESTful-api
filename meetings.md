* **ASSISTANTS: Ivan**
* **Participants: Martti, Juho, Kalle, Lauri

### Minutes
Discussion about the database model that we have provided thus far. Lightly evaluating the current model.

Some work was found to be done for the database model to achieve higher grade.

### Action points
- Provide more information in README.md from the database architechture (technologies used etc...)
- Mention which software is used in wiki information (to show tables) to help assistants
- Provide all information available, e.g. database limitations, hyperlinks in README.md

- Better README for database, include own README in database folder. Take some hint from CONTRIBUTING.md folder
- Add ondelete behavior

Better routing, maybe route breeds under groups, link facts to breeds /api/groups/breed/facts/n-fact
/api/groups/terrier/breeds/23872
maybe hash groups breeds in database to not EXPOSE PRIMARY KEYS in url, maybe add url in underscore e.g. Australian_terrier or Australian%20terrier, latter is handled in SQLalchemy to result in Australian terrier
Explain addressability and uniform interface more betterly, architecture statelesness, Use better project layout from lovelace. Better documentation
